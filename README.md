# The Great Space Clicker

What is the great space clicker? 

Well it's just like any other clicker game, you click the main item, get some score and then invest that score in generators so that you can get even more score and reach the top of the leaderboards.

## Cool features

### Big Ints

In case the game becomes very big I have future proofed by ensuring that the numbers in the game ustilise the big int class so that I can have numbers that are larger than the 64bit signed limit, TO INFINITY!

There isn't much in the game just yet but right now there is super funny meme and some AI-approved content (I asked chatGPT if the UI looked nice (I did not use AI to generate the UI) )

## AI content disclosure

The majority of this game is written by the hands of me, however I have 0 experience in GLSL (shaders) so any shaders you find in the game have been generated by AI, you can check the "Shaders" folder for the AI-generated shaders. Right now there is only 2 shaders (and probably will stay 2).

These 2 files total far less than the 30% threshold for siege but I thought it would be best to disclose my usage anyways. Thanks
